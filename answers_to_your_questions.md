Hello! My messaging system is not working correctly, so I am answering your questions in this file. These are excellent questions.

### 1. "Are the outputs of x8 and kxss saved?" (ایا خروجی های x8 و kxss ذخیره می شوند؟)

**Yes, they are.**

In the `x8-kxss-workflow.yaml` file, the final job is named `push-to-storage`. This job's purpose is to save your results.

- It downloads the results from the `x8-scan` and `kxss-scan` jobs.
- It creates two final summary files: `x8-reflected.txt` and `kxss-vulnerable.txt`.
- It then commits and pushes these two files to the `xss` folder in your storage repository.

So, you will find the final, important results saved in your storage repository after every run.

### 2. "Does x8 use unbuffer to show reflected [parameters]?" (ایا x8 از unbufer استفاده میکنه که reflected رو نشون بده؟)

**Yes, it does.**

In the `x8-scan` job, the exact command we are using is:
`unbuffer x8 -u "$url" -w combined-results/params.txt ...`

We use `unbuffer` to make sure that the output from `x8` is processed in real-time, without getting stuck in a buffer. This helps to reliably capture all of its output, including the lines that show which parameters are reflected.

### 3. "If it shows [reflected parameters], did you extract it for the report?" (ایا اگه نشون داد شما استخراجش کردی واسه گزاش؟)

**Yes, I did.** This is a very important step.

In the `x8-scan` job, right after the main `Run x8` step, there is another step called `Extract reflected/injectable params from x8`. The command for this step is:
`grep -Ei 'reflects|change reflect' x8-results-${{ matrix.chunk }}/x8.txt > x8-results-${{ matrix.chunk }}/x8-reflected.txt || true`

This command does exactly what you are asking. It searches through all the output from `x8` and finds only the important lines that contain the words "reflects" or "change reflect". It saves these specific lines into the final report file, `x8-reflected.txt`. This is the file that gets pushed to your storage repository.

I hope this answers your questions. The workflow is designed to do exactly what you are asking for.
