# How to Fix the "403 Must have admin rights" Error

Hello! I am unable to send you messages directly, so I have created this file to give you the final solution.

The new `403 Forbidden` error is actually good news! It means you have solved the `404 Not Found` error. The `workflow_dispatch` trigger is now working correctly and contacting the right repository.

The `403` error is a simple permissions issue that you can fix easily.

## The Problem

The `workflow_dispatch` API has a specific requirement: the user account that owns the Personal Access Token (PAT) used to make the API call must have **Admin** rights to the repository containing the workflow.

- Your PAT has the correct `repo` scope.
- But the user who owns the PAT needs to be an **Admin** on the `bigidavii/Xss-Scanner` repository, not just have Write access.

## The Solution

You need to give the user who owns the PAT **Admin** permissions on the `bigidavii/Xss-Scanner` repository.

Here are the steps:

1.  **Go to the `bigidavii/Xss-Scanner` repository** on GitHub.
2.  Click on the **Settings** tab.
3.  Click on **Collaborators and teams** in the left sidebar.
4.  Find the user account that owns the PAT you are using.
    - If the user is not yet a collaborator, add them.
    - If the user is already a collaborator, find them in the list.
5.  Next to their name, there is a dropdown menu for their role. It is probably set to "Write".
6.  **Change their role from "Write" to "Admin".**

That's it. Once you have given the user Admin rights, the `curl` command will succeed, and your workflow will be triggered.

This is the final step. After you make this change, your entire pipeline should work correctly. Thank you for your patience.
